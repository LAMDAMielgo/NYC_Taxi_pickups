NEW YOK CITY TAXI PICK-UPS
--------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a very simple reposity that contains a take home test for a
Junior Data Scientist position.


The project consist in two tasks:
    - ETL and data exploration and cleaning:
        · Cleaning NYC Taxi data from Jan, Apr and July 2015
        · Download the demographic and socio-economic data from the 
          American Community Survey
        · Merge the taxi and ACS dataset by block group and compute 
          the average number of pickups by block group

    - Modelling:
        Train a baseline model for the average number of pick-ups by 
        block group using as covariates the ACS variables.
        WHat is the model accuracy? What can we learn from this model?
